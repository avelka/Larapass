# Goal 

the goal of this fork is to fix the issues I had trying to use it in my current project:
- dont support custom provider out of the box and assume too much about user (email)
- dont support mysql as is (migration issue with binary in composite key)
- yubico issue regarding userHandle (not matchin or not realy supporting empty userHandle)
